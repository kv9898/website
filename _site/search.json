    "text": "Information on effects of medication therapies during pregnancy is lacking as pregnant patients are often excluded from clinical trials. This retrospective study explores the potential of using electronic health record (EHR) data to inform safety profiles of repurposed COVID medication therapies on pregnancy outcomes using pre-COVID data. We conducted a medication-wide association study (MWAS) on prescription medication exposures during pregnancy and the risk of cesarean section, preterm birth, and stillbirth, using EHR data between 2010–2017 on deliveries at PennMedicine. Repurposed drugs studied for treatment of COVID-19 were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 138). We adjusted for known comorbidities diagnosed within 2 years prior to birth. Using previously developed medication mapping and delivery-identification algorithms, we identified medication exposure in 2,830 of a total 63,334 deliveries; from 138 trials, we found 31 medications prescribed and included in our cohort. We found 21 (68%) of the 31 medications were not positively associated with increased risk of the outcomes examined. With caution, these medications warrant potential for inclusion of pregnant individuals in future studies, while drugs found to be associated with pregnancy outcomes require further investigation. MWAS facilitates hypothesis-driven evaluation of drug safety across all prescription medications, revealing potential drug candidates for further research."

    "text": "With Alison Hill’s Up and Running with Blogdown post! Super helpful, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like ‘up and running with lots of water breaks’ because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime.\n\nFor example, prior to Academic version 4.6, custom CSS was added using the plugins_css option in params.toml, but in current version 4.8, the theme supports SCSS (a superset of CSS) and a custom.scss file is added in the assets/scss/ folder.\n\nThe going futher section in Alison’s post specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom CSS file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in my custom SCSS file.\nAlison’s CSS helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Academic’s light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors for the most part and they just didn’t go.\n\nSo I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in params.toml until I could figure out how to customize my stylesheet accordingly. That time has come because it turns out it’s pretty straightforward!\nThe Blogdown book does an excellent job summarizing what you need to know about CSS. This post builds on that a little by incorporating features made possible by SCSS including variables."

    "text": "Basics of dark theme design\n\nThe primary surface color for dark themes should be dark gray, rather than black. The recommended color is #121212\nAs you layer components, surfaces with a higher elevation (closer to the hypothetical ‘light source’) should be lighter than those below it to create a visual hierarchy. This can be achieved by applying a semi-transparent white overlay to the primary dark gray surface.\n\n\n\nThe primary text color for dark themes should not be 100% opaque white (i.e. #FFFFFF) because it can appear to bleed or blur against dark backgrounds and be difficult to read.\nText hierarchy is established by controlling the opacity, for example:\n\nHigh emphasis text is white with 87% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87)\nMedium emphasis is white with 60% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.60)\nDisabled text is white with 38% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.38)\n\nTo meet WCAG AA standard, there must be a 4.5:1 contrast level between the body text and the dark theme surface at the highest/lightest elevation. The contrast level is 7:1 for the WCAG AAA standard."
