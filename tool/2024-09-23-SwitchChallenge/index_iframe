# How to Use the Switch Challenge Solver

This online version requires the user to translate the problem to a "formula" and enter it into the text box. For the GUI version, please refer to the [Github repository](https://github.com/kv9898/switch_challenge_solver).

There are two ways of using the full formula, long form and short form.

In the long form, you enter the input and output colors.

Let's use the hard case as an example, the formula would be:

`ybgr+1324+x+3241=gbyr`

::: {layout="[[30,70]]"}

![Long Formula](img/lf.png)
:::

The gist of the short formula form is that you encode the outcome (number after `=`) in such a way that it is a single switch from the input to the output. Note that you cannot use the short formula for the easiest problems (you solve it with your brain).

Let's use the same case as an example:

::: {layout="[[30,70]]"}
