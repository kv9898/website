## The Existing Clichés

From time to time, commentaries on the Chinese economy from economists have become more **BORING** than ever. Critics of China routinely cite its weak protection of private property and arbitrary state intervention in the market—but rarely explain why these problems have worsened in recent years, beyond vague or “personal” explanations.

Those who take a more neutral stance often focus on the property sector and local government debt crises, recommending central government bailouts while offering little on how to address the deeper structural issues that led to these crises in the first place. They also (rightly) call for a shift toward a consumption-driven economy, yet tend to gloss over the trade-offs and institutional obstacles involved, repeating the vague mantra that "the day will come."

Perhaps most uninspiring—if not outright amusing—are those who continue to cheerlead for the Chinese economy at this stage. Chief among them is Justin Yifu Lin, who has consistently overestimated China’s growth prospects in recent years and continues to advocate for investment-led rather than consumption-driven expansion, as though it were still the 2010s. These economists continue to place false hope in 'industrial upgrading' as a panacea for all existing problems, without considering who will actually consume the resulting flood of products.

# The Political Roots

While the third group of economists are simply *wrong*, what the other two groups lack—or perhaps choose not to acknowledge—is a deeper understanding of the *political* roots underlying China’s economic problems. By “political,” I don’t mean the simplistic dichotomy between “authoritarianism” and “democracy” often drawn by thinkers like Acemoglu—that would be far too dull an argument to make. I'm not the kind of writer who hides behind unnecessarily long paragraphs and jargon without getting to the point. My response is clear and concise, as outlined below.

1.  [Immediate Short Term – Good news: The main obstacles to rebooting the economy are ideational, not structural.](#sec-short)

2.  [Short-Medium Term: Growth and superpower status at the cost of twin deficits and export competitiveness.](#sec-short-medium)

2.  [Medium-Long Term: The property sector crisis, mounting local government debt, and—at least in part—the weak foundation of consumption, rooted in the distorted central–local government relationship.](#sec-medium-long)

3.  Long Term: A Marxist-Leninist state *cannot* credibly commit to protecting private property or a market economy. This is still the elephant in the room.

# Immediate Short Term: Ideational Obstacles {#sec-short}

Simply put, ideas matter. This is something I hate to admit—as a political economy student trained in formal theory and quantitative empirics, I've never been a fan of constructivism (in International Relations). I’ve always found it difficult to assess the impact of people’s thoughts. It’s prone to reverse causality and often devolves into circular reasoning.

But I would argue that China is different—something else I hate to admit. This is because Chinese politics have reached a point where structural factors (interest groups, institutions, conventions) can be overridden by the beliefs or even whims of the leader in decision-making. This is bad news for formal modellers, who rely on stable institutions and rationality, and for empiricists, who base predictions on past data. Ideational factors become especially crucial in the short term, when structural forces have yet to fully unfold and compel the leader to adjust their policies.

This distortion is caused by the flawed information flow between the leader and their subordinates/advisors. The subordinates and advisors often speculate about the leader's policy preferences and present "evidence" and "rationale" to support these assumptions. Conversely, policy advice that contradicts the leader's preferences is either censored before reaching the leader or, more tragically, self-censored by the advisors themselves. Behind this distorted information flow lies the logic of loyalty: any opposition to the leader's views is seen as a threat to their authority, or even a sign of a political coup—something that has historically occurred in China. On the other hand, supporting the leader’s (often flawed) policy preference signals loyalty, and those who do so tend to be protected, even when things go wrong.

Therefore, the message is clear: he dislikes ["feeding the lazy" (养懒汉)](http://theory.people.com.cn/n1/2021/1116/c40531-32283350.html) and sees no issue with [deflation](https://fortune.com/2024/12/29/china-economy-deflation-xi-jinping-growth-slump-consumer-producer-prices/). Until he changes his mind, no real progress toward a consumer economy will be made. The solution, ironically, is also quite simple: wait until things deteriorate so badly that the leader is forced to make a U-turn—much like what happened with the COVID-19 lockdown reversal in 2022.

This also helps to explain [Paul Krugman’s puzzle over why China is “bizarrely unwilling” to boost consumption](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/krugman-says-china-is-bizarrely-unwilling-to-boost-demand). Krugman's assumption—that a left-wing government should be naturally inclined to expand the welfare state and stimulate consumption—runs up against a premodern mindset, arguably rooted in China’s agricultural and early industrial traditions, where production and thrift are valued, while hedonism is morally condemned. However, Krugman’s intuition is not wrong: expanding social welfare and promoting consumption are not inherently at odds with Communist ideology. In fact, such policies could not only revive the economic momentum but also enhance the ruling party’s legitimacy as a "party for the people."

While *simple cash handouts* (AND DEFINITELY NOT MORE INVESTMENT) may offer a short-term solution, their sustainability is questionable without further structural changes, and the costs are likely to emerge in the [short to medium term](#sec-short-medium).

# Short-Medium Term: Becoming Like America {#sec-short-medium}

The key to sustained consumption growth is inflation-more specifically, a healthy wage–price spiral. One can better understand this argument by returning to a question President Xi once asked: ["what's so bad about deflation?"](https://fortune.com/2024/12/29/china-economy-deflation-xi-jinping-growth-slump-consumer-producer-prices/) The answer is simple: when prices are falling, people tend to *delay* consumption, waiting for even lower prices. In this sense, inflation is not just a consequence of consumption—it can also be a *cause* of it. Deferred consumption, in turn, often leads to layoffs, wage cuts, and rising real debt burdens, all of which further weaken consumer demand. This self-reinforcing cycle is known as the deflationary spiral.

Furthermore, China’s current deflation poses a problem that Beijing may not have fully realized—it is worsening the country’s international relations. China's unmatched industrial competitiveness has expanded into high value-added sectors, sparking concern among developed economies. Crucially, this *industrial upgrading* has not been accompanied by a retreat from low-end manufacturing, which concerns the developing economies. In fact, [efforts to shift supply chains away from China have been only partially successful](https://www.scmr.com/article/shift-from-china-is-leading-to-india#:~:text=Despite%20these%20continued%20plans%20to,and%20faster%20time%20to%20market).

What’s more, China is unable to offer its own domestic market to trading partners in a reciprocal way. Due to weak domestic demand, Chinese imports from other countries are [*declining* in both RMB and USD terms](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/china/story20250307-5981406). As a result, China is not only exporting goods—but also exporting the pain of deflation to its trade partners. These partners are facing growing pressure to protect their own industries and jobs from Chinese competition—creating a structural tension that diplomacy alone cannot resolve.

The benefits of inflation are essentially the reverse: people spend more in anticipation of rising prices. Firms hire more and raise wages—making people more able to consume. As a byproduct, China would also import more goods and services from abroad, improving its image on the international stage and strengthening its diplomatic leverage. Once China achieves a *trade deficit*, there will even be a foundation for China to truly *internationalise* its currency and even replace the status of the US dollar (see @Germain2017 for a great discussion on this).

Moreover, inflation could help alleviate three of the current administration’s major headaches: the property sector crisis, local government debt, and wealth inequality. The core dilemma in the property sector is that high housing prices stimulate property-linked industries but at the expense of other sectors—and, crucially, undermine young people’s willingness to have children. In contrast, low housing prices create a negative wealth effect and trigger a credit crunch, further fuelling the deflationary spiral. In this sense, the sector behaves like a cancer: too aggressive to contain, yet too dangerous to remove entirely.

*Inflation* offers a viable way out of this problem. Property prices *may* rise, but as long as they grow at a slower pace than the overall inflation rate, the bubble can be effectively *inflated away*. Similarly, the accumulated debts of local governments—as well as the central government’s stimulus-related borrowing—can also be inflated away if nominal growth (roughly real GDP growth plus inflation) outpaces the rate of debt accumulation. In essence, this is a more subtle and intelligent form of deleveraging.

More interestingly, inflation also serves as a tool for implicit redistribution. In a country where good investment options are scarce—capital controls remain in place, the housing market is struggling, the stock market is a joke, and government bond yields are, remarkably, *lower than Japan’s*—the wealthy have few reliable channels to preserve their wealth. Gold and cryptocurrencies may seem like alternatives, but I would argue that their supply is far too limited to absorb the scale of China’s capital stock.

However, sustaining inflation is not without cost—it requires a shift in income distribution away from capital (in the form of profits) and toward labour (in the form of wages). The reason is simple: **capital does not consume—it invests**. A pro-capital distribution model encourages the expansion of productive capacity, which in turn adds to deflationary pressure and forces the government to run ever-larger deficits to plug the demand-side gap—an approach that is ultimately unsustainable.

Alright, enough economics. Let’s turn to the real challenge: politics. Here's the political cost—making this kind of distributional shift would require empowering independent trade unions (not the current state-sanctioned mascots). That means enabling collective bargaining, tolerating strikes, and genuinely enforcing labour laws. These are all perfectly sensible policies for a left-wing government—but the CCP remains deeply reluctant to embrace them.

Moreover, inflation inevitably comes at the cost of export competitiveness. This means Beijing will need to find ways to *take care of* its export sectors. I *hope* it will achieve this by building a social safety net that enables both labour and capital in these industries to transition toward the service sector.

These are significant commitments—and not easily reversed. If inflation overshoots or the economy overheats, dialing it back can be painful. Tightening monetary policy in such a context is financially costly, especially for a highly indebted government following rounds of quantitative easing (QE)—a topic I explored in my [Master's dissertation](https://rubuky.com/papers/2024-08-20-BailoutCB/), if you’re interested.

Trying to reverse the inflationary path by rolling back supportive policies would be politically costly, and would require a level of democratic legitimacy that the current system may not be willing—or able—to provide.
