## The Existing Clichés

From time to time, commentaries on the Chinese economy from economists have become more **BORING** than ever. Critics of China routinely cite its weak protection of private property and arbitrary state intervention in the market—but rarely explain why these problems have worsened in recent years, beyond vague or “personal” explanations. 

Those who take a more neutral stance often focus on the property sector and local government debt crises, recommending central government bailouts while offering little on how to address the deeper structural issues that led to these crises in the first place. They also (rightly) call for a shift toward a consumption-driven economy, yet tend to gloss over the trade-offs and institutional obstacles involved, repeating the vague mantra that "the day will come."

Perhaps most uninspiring—if not outright amusing—are those who continue to cheerlead for the Chinese economy at this stage. Chief among them is Justin Yifu Lin, who has consistently overestimated China’s growth prospects in recent years and continues to advocate for investment-led rather than consumption-driven expansion, as though it were still the 2010s. These economists continue to place false hope in 'industrial upgrading' as a panacea for all existing problems, without considering who will actually consume the resulting flood of products.

# The Political Roots

While the third group of economists are simply *wrong*, what the other two groups lack—or perhaps choose not to acknowledge—is a deeper understanding of the *political* roots underlying China’s economic problems. By “political,” I don’t mean the simplistic dichotomy between “authoritarianism” and “democracy” often drawn by thinkers like Acemoglu—that would be far too dull an argument to make. I'm not the kind of writer who hides behind unnecessarily long paragraphs and jargon without getting to the point. My response is clear and concise, as outlined below.

1. Short Term – Good news: The main obstacles to rebooting the economy are ideational, not structural.

2. Medium Term: The property sector crisis, mounting local government debt, and—at least in part—the weak foundation of consumption, rooted in the distorted central–local government relationship.

3. Long Term: A Marxist-Leninist state *cannot* credibly commit to protecting private property or a market economy. This is still the elephant in the room.
