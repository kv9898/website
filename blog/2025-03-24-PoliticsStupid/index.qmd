## The Existing Clichés

From time to time, commentaries on the Chinese economy from economists have become more **BORING** than ever. Critics of China routinely cite its weak protection of private property and arbitrary state intervention in the market—but rarely explain why these problems have worsened in recent years, beyond vague or “personal” explanations.

Those who take a more neutral stance often focus on the property sector and local government debt crises, recommending central government bailouts while offering little on how to address the deeper structural issues that led to these crises in the first place. They also (rightly) call for a shift toward a consumption-driven economy, yet tend to gloss over the trade-offs and institutional obstacles involved, repeating the vague mantra that "the day will come."

Perhaps most uninspiring—if not outright amusing—are those who continue to cheerlead for the Chinese economy at this stage. Chief among them is Justin Yifu Lin, who has consistently overestimated China’s growth prospects in recent years and continues to advocate for investment-led rather than consumption-driven expansion, as though it were still the 2010s. These economists continue to place false hope in 'industrial upgrading' as a panacea for all existing problems, without considering who will actually consume the resulting flood of products.

# The Political Roots

While the third group of economists are simply *wrong*, what the other two groups lack—or perhaps choose not to acknowledge—is a deeper understanding of the *political* roots underlying China’s economic problems. By “political,” I don’t mean the simplistic dichotomy between “authoritarianism” and “democracy” often drawn by thinkers like Acemoglu—that would be far too dull an argument to make. I'm not the kind of writer who hides behind unnecessarily long paragraphs and jargon without getting to the point. My response is clear and concise, as outlined below.

1.  [Immediate Short Term – Good news: The main obstacles to rebooting the economy are ideational, not structural.](#sec-short)

2.  [Short-Medium Term: Growth and superpower status at the cost of twin deficits and export competitiveness.](#sec-short-medium)

2.  Medium-Long Term: The property sector crisis, mounting local government debt, and—at least in part—the weak foundation of consumption, rooted in the distorted central–local government relationship.

3.  Long Term: A Marxist-Leninist state *cannot* credibly commit to protecting private property or a market economy. This is still the elephant in the room.

# Immediate Short Term: Ideational Obstacles {#sec-short}

Simply put, ideas matter. This is something I hate to admit—as a political economy student trained in formal theory and quantitative empirics, I've never been a fan of constructivism (in International Relations). I’ve always found it difficult to assess the impact of people’s thoughts. It’s prone to reverse causality and often devolves into circular reasoning.

But I would argue that China is different—something else I hate to admit. This is because Chinese politics have reached a point where structural factors (interest groups, institutions, conventions) can be overridden by the beliefs or even whims of the leader in decision-making. This is bad news for formal modellers, who rely on stable institutions and rationality, and for empiricists, who base predictions on past data. Ideational factors become especially crucial in the short term, when structural forces have yet to fully unfold and compel the leader to adjust their policies.

This distortion is caused by the flawed information flow between the leader and their subordinates/advisors. The subordinates and advisors often speculate about the leader's policy preferences and present "evidence" and "rationale" to support these assumptions. Conversely, policy advice that contradicts the leader's preferences is either censored before reaching the leader or, more tragically, self-censored by the advisors themselves. Behind this distorted information flow lies the logic of loyalty: any opposition to the leader's views is seen as a threat to their authority, or even a sign of a political coup—something that has historically occurred in China. On the other hand, supporting the leader’s (often flawed) policy preference signals loyalty, and those who do so tend to be protected, even when things go wrong.

Therefore, the message is clear: he dislikes ["feeding the lazy" (养懒汉)](http://theory.people.com.cn/n1/2021/1116/c40531-32283350.html) and sees no issue with [deflation](https://fortune.com/2024/12/29/china-economy-deflation-xi-jinping-growth-slump-consumer-producer-prices/). Until he changes his mind, no real progress toward a consumer economy will be made. The solution, ironically, is also quite simple: wait until things deteriorate so badly that the leader is forced to make a U-turn—much like what happened with the COVID-19 lockdown reversal in 2022.

This also helps to explain [Paul Krugman’s puzzle over why China is “bizarrely unwilling” to boost consumption](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/krugman-says-china-is-bizarrely-unwilling-to-boost-demand). Krugman's assumption—that a left-wing government should be naturally inclined to expand the welfare state and stimulate consumption—runs up against a premodern mindset, arguably rooted in China’s agricultural and early industrial traditions, where production and thrift are valued, while hedonism is morally condemned. However, Krugman’s intuition is not wrong: expanding social welfare and promoting consumption are not inherently at odds with Communist ideology. In fact, such policies could not only revive the economic momentum but also enhance the ruling party’s legitimacy as a "party for the people."

While *simple cash handouts* (AND DEFINITELY NOT MORE INVESTMENT) may offer a short-term solution, their sustainability is questionable without further structural changes, and the costs are likely to emerge in the [short to medium term](#sec-short-medium).
