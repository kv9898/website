# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The existing literature has shown that current monetary tools are insufficient to address the current issue of stagflation and have contributed to the pre-existing problems of wealth inequality and high debt levels. Therefore, I propose a new set of monetary tools, namely the “Inverted Monetary Policy” (IMP), as part of the solution to these mentioned problems. I argue that this new set of tools has a disinflationary impact in the short term and redistributive effects in the medium to long term. In a nutshell, this policy “borrows from the future” to suppress current prices, and the cost is paid mostly by the high-income class. Extra fiscal revenue might come as a side effect of this policy. Nevertheless, the policy would involve reforms of the monetary institutions and the fiscal-monetary relationship, and policy-makers need to face trade-offs between different policy objectives.

# Introduction

As of 2022, central banks in the West have generally reversed their previous position that inflation was “transitory” [@BoE2021; @ECB2021; @Powell2021] and admitted the persistence of inflation as evident in their hawkish turn. Despite the late acknowledgements of the problem, they are far from solving it.

Existing monetary policy tools (including the 10-year-old “unconventional” monetary policies) have only one dimension of “easing” and “tightening”, therefore leaving central banks with a trade-off between economic activities, such as unemployment, growth and inflation. However, due to the supply-side shocks, the current wave of inflation is unusually compounded by the current economic stagnation [@WorldBank2022] and a likely recession in both Europe [@Look2022] and the United States [@Wingrove2022] next year. This limits the margin of manoeuvre of monetary policy. The capacity of the central bank to raise interest rates is limited in fear of a severe recession and collapsing markets (IMF). With existing tools, inflation and recession will not be an “either-or” question but rather “both-and”.

**Problems associated with previous monetary policy tools:**

Past monetary policy tools have contributed to some of today’s economic problems.

The Austrian School has been blaming recessions and economic crises on artificially low interest rates long before the recent crises [@Polleit2011]; excessive borrowing eventually becomes unsustainable when interest rates rise. Later tools, such as the Quantitative easing (QE) have also added to the unsustainable expansion of credit as it functions through lowering the long-term interest rates, which equally encourages borrowing and discourages savings [@BoE2023]. Woodford’s [-@Woodford2016] model suggests that “a combination of the expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet with a suitable tightening of macroprudential policy can have a net expansionary effect on aggregate demand with no increased risk to financial stability”. However, his assumption of a perfectly met inflation target does not rule out more financial instability at a time when inflation is out of control. The mismatch between expectations and the reality in uncontrolled circumstances could induce fear and irrationality in the markets, which could lead to financial instability.

Another problem associated with expansionary monetary policies is increased wealth inequality. @Imrohoroglu2022 find that lower interest rates increase wealth inequality as entrepreneurs benefit from lower financing costs while workers face lower returns on their assets, especially bank deposits. Similarly, @Montecino2015 suggest that quantitative easing (QE) is, at best, modestly dis-equalising as equity price appreciations outweigh the positive impacts on employment and mortgage refinancing. @Bonifacio2022 suggests that the effects of interest rates and QE on wealth distribution are ambiguous and depend on the composition of assets and liabilities of households’ balance sheet, whereby wealth inequality rises in societies with lower levels of home ownership. Moreover, @Silva2022 found that inequality limits the stabilisation effect of monetary policy. Although there is a negative correlation between wealth inequality and economic growth [@Madsen2020; @Milanovic2021], the causal link is yet to be proven. Conversely, @Colciago2018 suggests the impact of unconventional monetary policies on inequality is also not clear-cut. Nevertheless, the negative impact of wealth inequality on political instability and polarisation is demonstrated, which is a rising concern [@Stewart2020; @Pabst2022].

Moreover, significant losses made by central banks are a new feature associated with contractionary monetary policy after massive quantitative easing. Such losses add a burden to public finance. Significant losses to the central banks arise when they raise the interest rates and sell the assets at lower prices, which they previously bought at high prices with lower interest rates; higher interest rates also mean more interests are paid on the reserves held with the central bank. As both asset purchases/sales and interest rates are decided by central banks conducting monetary policy, this is a “self-inflicted harm”. Nevertheless, the losses made by monetary authorities are paid directly or indirectly by the taxpayers. The burden is heavier in places where the “negative dividend rule” applies (i.e. Treasury pays a “negative dividend” to the central bank when it runs a negative net income), such as the UK. On 22 Nov 2022, the Treasury of the UK bailed out the Bank of England for the first losses of £828mn from rate hikes after quantitative easing; the OBR estimated that the Treasury would need to pay the BoE £133bn over the next five years, which outweighs the cumulative profits of £122bn remitted to the Treasury [@Giles2022]. The impact is lower in places where the loss is paid by the central bank itself with future profits, such as the US, Australia, Switzerland, Czech Republic [@Reis2015; @Chaboud2013]. Many economies, such as the Eurozone and South Korea, take a middle approach whereby governments are only required to recapitalise the central banks to when the losses are large enough to deplete the central banks’ reserves [@Chaboud2013]. Therefore, public finances are ultimately burdened by the losses made by central banks in terms of direct payment from the treasury to the central bank or reduced remittances from the central bank to the government. Many media outlets (including The Economist and Financial Times) portray this loss for a public authority as harmless, invoking the duty of a central bank being maintaining price stability and minimising unemployment instead of profits, and losses do not impair their ability to conduct monetary policy. But if this loss could be avoided by changing the sequence of the policy tools without affecting the policy outcome (as demonstrated later) — why not?
