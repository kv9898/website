# Abstract

The existing literature has shown that current monetary tools are insufficient to address the current issue of stagflation and have contributed to the pre-existing problems of wealth inequality and high debt levels. Therefore, I propose a new set of monetary tools, namely the “Inverted Monetary Policy” (IMP), as part of the solution to these mentioned problems. I argue that this new set of tools has a disinflationary impact in the short term and redistributive effects in the medium to long term. In a nutshell, this policy “borrows from the future” to suppress current prices, and the cost is paid mostly by the high-income class. Extra fiscal revenue might come as a side effect of this policy. Nevertheless, the policy would involve reforms of the monetary institutions and the fiscal-monetary relationship, and policy-makers need to face trade-offs between different policy objectives.

# Introduction

As of 2022, central banks in the West have generally reversed their previous position that inflation was “transitory” [@BoE2021; @ECB2021; @Powell2021] and admitted the persistence of inflation as evident in their hawkish turn. Despite the late acknowledgements of the problem, they are far from solving it.
