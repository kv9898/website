**Despite pessimism around China’s growth, researchers Jackson Huang and Dianyi Yang argue for optimism. They see strengthening ties with the global south and transitioning to a consumption-led economy as crucial steps for sustainable growth.**

For much of the past few decades, China’s engagement with the global south has been defined as importing raw materials and financing large-scale infrastructure abroad. Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China signed around 340 BRI-related deals across 149 countries, totalling US$121.8 billion in investments and contracts, funding railways, highways, ports and energy projects across Asia, Africa and Latin America. 

However, recent developments suggest that China’s relationship with the global south might be at a turning point. As the real risk of US-China decoupling increases and trade tensions escalate, this relationship has taken on renewed strategic importance. Yet with policymakers hesitant to roll out strong measures to stimulate domestic demand despite official recognition of the need to do so, Chinese producers have turned to neijuan (internal competition) and overseas expansion as survival strategies.

However, the surge of Chinese exports —both intermediate and final goods — into developing markets has raised concerns about the displacement of local industries and risked eroding trust and generating economic tensions.  

Now, it is time for China to rethink its approach. If the domestic impact of a sluggish recovery has not swayed policymakers into implementing stronger stimulus measures, the potential to strain relationships with developing countries, especially amid escalating US-China trade tensions, should. At the very least, China can do more at home to ensure that industrial overcapacity does not undermine local economies elsewhere. 

# No bold action

In the past week, the world has been astonished by the rapid escalation of President Trump’s global trade war. One week after the 2 April announcement, the US has singled out China, imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods. In response, China has imposed retaliatory tariffs of up to 125% on US imports — effectively triggering a major decoupling between the two economies.

For China, the escalation comes as policymakers grapple with weak consumption and persistent deflationary signals. While it continues to maintain a growth rate of 5% and has made impressive advancements in AI and high-end manufacturing, domestic consumption has shown signs of weakening.

The GDP deflator, a broad measure of price changes, fell to -0.8% in the last quarter of 2024, down from -0.5% in the previous quarter, indicating continued deflationary pressures. Meanwhile, China’s value-added industrial output grew by 5.8% year-on-year in 2024, an increase from 4.6% in 2023. This divergence between production growth and subdued consumer demand suggests challenges related to overcapacity, where supply outpaces domestic market absorption. 

> Li Daokui argued that the central government has ample fiscal space to issue debt and fund such initiatives. Yet the common conclusion is that the barrier is not capability, but a lack of willingness to pursue bold action.

There is no shortage of proposals on how China could boost domestic demand. Leading economists and former policymakers — including Li Daokui, Liu Shijin, Liu Yuanchun, and Jin Keyu — have all emphasised the need for a bolder approach. Proposed measures include billion-dollar direct cash transfers to households, substantial expansion of social welfare programmes, or a large-scale bailout of the local government debt sector.

At the 2025 China Development Forum on 23 March, Li Daokui argued that the central government has ample fiscal space to issue debt and fund such initiatives. Yet the common conclusion is that the barrier is not capability, but a lack of willingness to pursue bold action. Instead, policymakers have remained highly cautious and conservative, opting for a gradual, “toothpaste-squeezing” strategy, forcing the Chinese businesses to expand into overseas markets out of necessity rather than opportunity.

# China’s trade imbalances and concern from the Global South

Like many other socialist states, China has long valued high savings rates and an export-driven economy, seeing them as key drivers of industrial expansion and technological advancement. This mindset is deeply rooted in the belief that consumerism equates to hedonism (享乐主义), shaping policies that favor investment and production over domestic consumption. At the same time, China has maintained a strong skepticism toward high-welfare states (高福利国家), often viewing them as economically unsustainable and detrimental to competitiveness. As a result, In spite of its position as a global powerhouse, China has, since reform and opening up, remained as a market driven by investment and export. Despite the impressive increase in GDP per capita, its consumption has remained around 50% of its GDP (sometimes even much lower) even at its highest growing years. 

Furthermore, in contrast to the steady economic growth observed between 2016 and 2020, the Chinese economy has encountered some difficulty in adjustments and structural shifts in the post-Covid period. While it continues to maintain a growth rate of 5% and has made impressive advancements in AI and high-end manufacturing, domestic consumption has shown signs of weakening. The GDP deflator, a broad measure of price changes, fell to -0.8% in the last quarter of 2024, down from -0.5% in the previous quarter, indicating continued deflationary pressures. Meanwhile, China’s value-added industrial output grew by 5.8% year-on-year in 2024, an increase from 4.6% in 2023. This divergence between production growth and subdued consumer demand suggests challenges related to overcapacity, where supply outpaces domestic market absorption. 

Lately, discussions in China have increasingly focused on transitioning towards a consumption-driven economy, or at a minimum, implementing more aggressive measures to stimulate domestic consumption to address current economic  challenges. Academics and retired officials, such as Liu Shijin and Li Daokui, have extensively articulated the benefits of such a shift. However, the Chinese government has remained extremely cautious and conservative about taking more aggressive actions to stimulate consumption, leaving the transition towards a consumer economy still slow and uncertain. 

As a result, China’s reliance on external markets has increased substantially as evidenced by the growing trend of 企业出海 (corporate expansion abroad). While this strategy provides new growth opportunities for firms facing a saturated domestic market and rising competition ("内卷"), it is not doing China a huge favour on the international platform. In both developed and developing economies, China’s large-scale exports are triggering protectionist responses. The US and the EU have imposed tariffs on key Chinese industries, including a 45% tax on electric vehicles. In addition, the effects of China’s growing exports extend beyond developed economies, with notable impacts also emerging in developing regions. 

# Impact on ASEAN countries

For example, while ASEAN has previously benefited significantly from increased Chinese investment and greater integration into global supply chains  with intermediate goods imported from China, the influx of final goods is placing huge pressure on its member states. Since 2023, ASEAN has seen a rapid increase in Chinese exports, which have outpaced those to the US and EU since 2023, rising another 12% in 2024, when ASEAN exports to China have declined by 3% since 2022, contributing to widening trade imbalances. While China has traditionally supplied ASEAN with intermediate goods that support regional industries, a growing share of exports is now directed toward ASEAN’s consumer markets, leading to competition with local businesses. Indonesia’s textile sector, for instance, has faced restructuring, with 80,000 workers laid off in 2024 and another 280,000 j obs potentially affected in 2025 as companies adjust to shifting market conditions. Vietnam has also seen a significant rise in small-scale Chinese e-commerce imports, with an estimated 4 to 5 million small-value orders daily, amounting to nearly US$2 billion per month.  

In response, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia have all taken steps to address the rising influx of low-cost Chinese imports, particularly through e-commerce platforms. In 2024, Thailand introduced a 7% value-added tax (VAT) on low-value imports to level the playing field for domestic producers, while also setting up a task force to review trade measures. Vietnam is planning a similar VAT poli cy while promoting domestic consumption through its "Made-in-Vietnam" campaign. Indonesia has taken a stronger stance by banning e-commerce platforms like Temu, citing unfair competition and regulatory concerns. Recently, Vietnam followed suit in suspending the operations of Temu and Shein.These measures reflect growing efforts across ASEAN to balance economic engagement with China while protecting local industries from excessive market pressure. Similar trends are emerging in Latin America, South Asia, and Central Asia, where Chinese exports are increasingly replacing local industrial landscape, prompting discussions on long-term economic adjustments.

This shift is particularly concerning for China at a time when it has placed south-south cooperation, global south diplomacy and shared development at the forefront of its international strategy. The growing economic friction with developing economies risks undermining China's efforts to position itself as a champion of the global south, potentially complicating its broader geopolitical and economic objectives.

# China as a unique case from past economic powers

It is crucial to recognise that China occupies a unique position compared to previous emerging economic powers, both due to its own characteristics and the broader era in which it operates. Historically, mercantilist policies that promote exports and discourage imports have  been a common strategy for rising industrial powers. The UK, Europe, Japan and the US all followed similar paths during their periods of rapid industrialisation. During these periods, colonisation was still ongoing, and it was not uncommon for industrial powers to use military force — gunboats and cannons — to open markets that resisted foreign imports. 

In the 19th century, Britain forcibly opened Chinese ports through treaties like the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842 and ensured its manufactured goods flooded Chinese markets, stalling local industrial development. In a more extreme case, the British East India Company’s duty-free exports to India, combined with restrictions on Indian imports, destroyed the country’s once-flourishing textile industry. Far from its present image as a staunch free-trade promo ter, the US once had one of the highest average tariff rates on manufactured imports in the world between 1861 and 1933, contributing to its rapid industrialisation and growth; it only began to promote worldwide free trade after 1942, when its industrial capacity became dominant and unchallengeable. It also used military and economic pressure to secure markets in Latin America. Similarly, Japan, following its Meiji Restoration, sought to compete with Western industrial powers by securing markets in Korea and Manchuria, which later escalated into imperial expansion.

However, the global context in which this occurred was vastly different. In that era, the economic structures of many colonies were deliberately shaped to favour the interests of industrialised nations, with local industries often stifled to maintain dependency on imported goods. Colonisers had little concern about the impact of their exports on local industrialisation, as the political and economic order favored their dominance. Protectionism by the more powerful nations was the norm and was not regulated by any international body. Today’s world operates under a vastly different system. The developing world that once served as captive markets are now sovereign nations with clear aspirations for industrialisation and development and seek to balance foreign trade with domestic industrial growth, ensuring that external economic interactions do not undermine their long-term development goals.  

Secondly, China differs from other emerging economies such as South Korea, Japan and Singapore, which have relied heavily on international trade for growth due to their relatively small domestic markets. Singapore, as a global financial and logistics hub, has specialised in biotechnology, petrochemicals, and high-end financial services, and its total trade volume is nearly 300% of its GDP, highlighting its deep dependence on global markets. These countries have focused on developing high-value, export-oriented industries where they hold strong comparative advantages. At the same time, these economies have strategically outsourced lower-end manufacturing to developing nations, particularly in Southeast Asia, facilitating industrial growth in the region.

However, China today is running on another model. Firstly, China is a market with a 1.4 billion population, with an education and skills base far exceeding that of most developing countries. In contrast, the combined population of the Asian Tigers — South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore — is only around 80 million, a fraction of China’s size. This means that, unlike the Asian Tigers, whose exports the world could absorb even if they did not consume domestically, China’s sheer scale makes it much harder for global markets to accommodate its industrial output if domestic demand remains weak.

Secondly, as mentioned above, China has effectively built a full-spectrum industrial supply chain (全产业链), allowing it to produce everything from basic to high-end finished products within its own borders. With its vast industrial ecosystem and competitive pricing, developing economies find it increasingly difficult to compete with China, hence explaining the aforementioned concerns. 

# How stimulating domestic consumption aids China’s international image

Looking at the example of the US, while it maintains significant military power and influence over the global financial system, its acceptance of an ongoing trade deficit and its role as a major consumer market for developing economies has long been another key aspect of its leadership. Since the end of World War II, the US has historically absorbed large volumes of imports and consistently ran trade deficits. By tolerating a certain degree of protectionism in emerging markets and accepting trade deficits, the US has allowed emerging economies to grow by exporting goods to its market.  

Countries like Japan, South Korea, and China have been among the biggest beneficiaries of this policy. In the early 1970s, the US trade deficit with Japan was under US$2 billion, but by the late 1970s, it had surged to nearly US$10 bill ion, and by 1985, it had grown to almost US$50 billion. A similar pattern followed with China and other developing economies, where these deficits allowed developing countries to profit from exporting manufactured goods to America while accumulating US dollars, which in turn supported their national development. Of course, successive administrations, from Reagan to Trump, have attempted to address trade imbalances through various policies and negotiations, albeit unsuccessfully. However, regardless of the political debate, many agreed that this model has indeed played an important role in shaping the global economic landscape and supporting the rise of key industrial economies.

Why was the US able to take this route? Firstly, the US economy is fundamentally consumer-driven. US private consumption contribution to nominal GDP ratio is updated quarterly, available from Mar 1947 to Dec 2024, with an average share of 63.5%. This robust consumer demand has allowed the US to absorb a substantial volume of imports, providing markets for goods from developing economies. Secondly, the US has undergone a structural shift towards high-end manufacturing and services, outsourcing lower-end manufacturing to countries with cost advantages. 

Lastly, the US has been willing to sustain long-term fiscal deficits, ensuring strong domestic demand and supporting global trade. The twin deficits have been sustainably financed by its well-established dollar recycling mechanism, which allows overseas dollars to flow back into the U.S. through financial markets. On the one hand, the capital account surplus supports the value of the dollar, offsetting depreciating pressures from its persistent current account deficit.. On the other hand, recycled dollars fund the US government and firms, benefiting American households through budget deficits and job creation, which in turn underpins demand for imports. This cycle has allowed the US to maintain a sustainable trade imbalance while reinforcing its role as the global financial centre.

Again, the authors are well aware of the discussions on neo-colonialism and neo-mercantilism and are not suggesting that the US or other developed economies acted out of pure altruism. However, given the early stages of development in much of the developing world between the 1960s and 2000s, the access to US consumer markets and integration into global supply chains nonetheless allowed many emerging economies to industrialise, expand their manufacturing sectors and accumulate capital.

# The case for a consumption-driven economy

In conclusion, while narratives such as “中国崩溃论” (China collapse) and “中国见顶论” (peak China) paint a pessimistic outlook, we take a more optimistic view and believe that China still holds significant potential for growth and transformation. We believe that its economic model is facing some challenges of rebalancing, and if domestic considerations alone are insufficient for Chinese policymakers to pursue large-scale stimulus measures and a structural shift towards a consumption-driven economy, external considerations might be the necessary catalyst.

In the past decade, China has played a significant role in supporting the development of the global south through large-scale infrastructure investments and financing initiatives, particularly under the BRI and the global development initiative. Despite criticism from Western media, the continued interest and participation of many developing nations in these programs reflect their perceived benefits and China’s growing influence in shaping global development. 

At a time when strengthening ties with the global south is more important than ever, China’s continued reliance on export-driven growth, particularly in these developing markets, risks generating economic friction and undermining diplomatic relationships. Now, the time has come for China to take on a greater responsibility as a consumer market for goods from developing economies. 

A shift towards a more consumption-led economy could significantly reduce China’s reliance on exports and ease trade ten sions with the global south. By boosting domestic demand, China would absorb more of its own production, reducing the need for companies to seek markets abroad, and support industrialisation in other global south countries. At the very least, China can consider ways to ensure that its industrial overcapacity does not displace local industries in developing countries, as an unchecked influx of low-cost Chinese goods could hinder their ability to develop competitive domestic industries. This shift would potentially foster a more sustainable and resilient economy at home and strengthen China’s long-term position as a leader in global development, ensuring that future growth is less dependent on external markets while reinforcing its global influence.
