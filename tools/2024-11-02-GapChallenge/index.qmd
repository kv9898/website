# How to Use the Switch Challenge Solver

Let's use the most difficult level 5 as an example:

![](img/problem.png "A level 5 gap challenge"){width=500px}

We first change the number of rows and columns of the solver to "5":

We then enter the existing patterns using numbers:

Alternatively, we can also snip the patterns from the screen and paste them into the solver:

Then hit `Enter` (if you are using a computer) or press the `Submit` button. If the problem is entered correctly, a full solution will be displayed:

![](img/answer.png "The solution"){width=100%}

In this case, `4`, which corresponds to the green trigangle, is the answer we are looking for.

In the end, we can hit ``~/` `` if on a computer, or hit `Clear` to clear the problem and move on to the next one.
