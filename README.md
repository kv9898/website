# Dianyi's Personal Website
Hi there, welcome to the github page for [my personal website](https://rubuky.com). The website is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) based on the [Silvia Canelón's](https://silviacanelon.com/) template, and deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I first used [Hugo Apéro](https://github.com/hugo-apero/) to build my site, inspired by Julia Silge's ([@juliasilge](https://github.com/juliasilge)) [website](https://juliasilge.com/). However, as a long-time Quarto user, I missed the Quarto funtionalities and wanted switch to Quarto but was put off by the complexity involved in the migration. Luckily, I found out [Silvia's blog post](https://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/) on her migration and followed her path. In line with my predecessors, this website is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) so feel free to reuse my and my predecessors' codes!
